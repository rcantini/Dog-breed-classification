# Dog-breed-classification
How to build a dog breed classifier with Keras and Tensorflow using Convolutional Neural Networks.

The model is aimed at classifying images belonging to 2 particular breeds: Chihuahua and pug.

In order to cope with the small amount of traning data, the model exploits three main techniques:
- Real time data augmentation during training
- Transfer Learning of a VGG16 CNN model
- Fine tuning

The obtained model achieves a classification accuracy of 93% on test images.
